 An interactive version of my Resume

The app contains 4 tabs at the bottom (Home, Education, Experience, and Projects) each showcasing details about me. 

The blue texts on the home tab are links email me, call me and to my different socials, respectively.
The blue text on the education tab is a link to my school website.
The blue text on the experience tab is a link to the website of the business.
The blue text on the experience tab is a link to the website of the business.
The blue text on the projects tab (or the background of the cardview) is a link to the individual projects on my github. The description texts are selectable to be copied.

It is a Kotlin - Android project that uses Viewpager 2 to house the tabs (fragments). 
Also, the minimum SDK is API 22 (Android 5.0).

It implements Google's new material 3 design language and is designed to look like a version of my actual Resume (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O4wFKm0qXDsZQu9g56EC59V-4hNxf6d4/view?usp=sharing) which is a free template on https://novoresume.com/.

I used Google's android library that enabled me use activities and fragmants in the app.
I also used hdodenhof's circleimageview library to show my profile image in a circular view

I would have loved to add more language translations since I already stored all the strings in a string res file for easy translation.
I would have also loved to create more screen layout files for the home tab if I had more time

The only challenge I faced trying the optimize the home tab to scale well for most devices
